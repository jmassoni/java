Joey Massoni. I worked with Pauline Callejas on this project.

“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”

We received advice from Mandy and Emily on occasion.

We didn't have enough time to implement a unique feature but we did customize our site's UI a bit.
